# Security Policy for ForenLIMS

## Reporting a Vulnerability

ForenLIMS supports responsible disclosure of security issues. You can report potential vulnerabilities **privately** via GitHub's built-in security reporting feature by clicking the "Security" tab and then "Report a vulnerability".

Alternatively, you can email the maintainers directly at: [daniel.zaumsegel@gmail.com]. Do **not** create a public issue for security problems.

Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested mitigation

We will respond as quickly as possible and coordinate disclosure responsibly.

## Supported Versions

ForenLIMS supports security fixes for the current stable release. Older releases may not receive security updates.

## Security Updates

Security fixes will be published via GitHub releases and documented in the CHANGELOG. We encourage users to update to the latest release as soon as possible.

## Acknowledgements

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit contributors who report security issues, unless anonymity is requested.
